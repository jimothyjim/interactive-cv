<h1>Welcome To My (Simon Freeman) Portfolio Site!</h1>

<p>
	This site was created to supplement my C.V and to showcase some of the things I've done. As this site was created
	as a showcase, some of the features are a bit superflous. I can also assure you I didn't use this to write my actual
	application! Some design choices were made to make sure I could at least generate the C.V I wrote, and while technically
	functional, other generated C.Vs may be somewhat lacking in the writing departmernt. Please feel free to generate
	a C.V based on my skills, or check out my portfolio, or even view all the non-sensitive source code for this site.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the time constraints needed to create this in time for the application deadline, some areas are lacking a little polish.
	Despite this, all the necessary functionality is in place and great care was taken to avoid any bugs. I will continue to improve
	this site for a while after sending in my application.
</p>
<p>
	To speed things up, I have made these quick add functions
